	<h2 class="center">Clarion West One-Day Workshop: Worldbuilding Made Easy</h2>
	<h3 class="center">March 28, 2020 — Seattle, WA</h3>
	<p class="left">In this day-long workshop for Clarion West, James will present a number of tried-and-true tactics for tricking yourself into developing intriguing science fiction and fantasy worlds in just minutes, even when you think you’re out of ideas. Learn how to ask yourself the right questions to jumpstart your imagination, letting you quickly create compelling cultures, creatures, religions, magic systems, and more. We’ll also cover how to avoid common worldbuilding traps, and how to use these same principles to surprise yourself with stories you didn’t expect. Finally, you’ll put these techniques to use in guided exercises, coming up with fun new setting ideas on the spot.
