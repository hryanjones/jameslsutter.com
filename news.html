<div id="9/9/17" class="blogTitle"><a href="#9/9/17">9/9/17 -- On Leaving Paizo</a></div>
		<div class="blogContent">
		<p>It's official: After 13 years, I'm leaving Paizo to focus on writing full-time. I'm thrilled that I got to guide Starfinder through the most successful game launch in Paizo's history, and I'm still deeply in love with (and hope to keep writing in) the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder, but the time has finally come for me to devote 100% of my attention to writing, rather than managing a division of a company. I have tremendous confidence in my colleagues at Paizo, and while it's hard to step away from my portion of the controls, I can't wait to see where they take things! </p>
		<p>You can find <a target="_blank" href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk41?Sutters-Last-Blog">my full farewell blog over on paizo.com</a>. Thank you to everyone who's supported me on this crazy adventure, and I hope you'll come with me into whatever's next!</p>

<div id="4/6/17" class="blogTitle"><a href="#4/6/17">4/6/17 -- Starfinder Core Rulebook Off To the Printer!</a></div>
		<div class="blogContent">
		<p>In case you were wondering what I've been up to for the last year, this has been pretty much all of it. Getting the Starfinder RPG off the ground has been the biggest challenge and triumph of my tabletop career, and I couldn't have done it without an amazing and dedicated team. The book hits at Gen Con this August, but of course there's still plenty to be done between now and then. A core rulebook is, after all, just the beginning... </p>

		<p>Many thanks to all the folks at Paizocon and online who've gone out of their way to track me down and express excitement about the game. It's intensely gratifying to be working on a project so many people care about, and I can't wait to show you all what we've come up with at Gen Con 2017.

		<div class="blogContent">
		<p>If it seems like I only ever update my website from the strange half-real dimension that is convention travel, that's because it's true. I'm currently running on three hours of jet-lagged sleep as I prepare for the glorious madness that is Gen Con, but there's <i>so much</i> to tell that I can't put it off any longer.</p>
		<p>First things first: <b><i>The Redemption Engine</i> won the Scribe Award for Best Original Novel!</b> The Scribes are awarded by the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers at San Diego Comicon for the best books and other written work tied into existing properties, and my novel was up against books based on such properties as Star Trek, Grimm, Sleepy Hollow, and more. I ended up tying for first with Christa Faust's <i>Sins of the Father</i>, tied into the show Fringe. It's a huge honor, and I'm deeply thankful for both the judges' decision and all the kind wishes from other authors.</p>
		<p>In other news, I did probably the longest interview of my life, corresponding over the course of a month with Aidan Moher over at the Hugo Award-winning <i>A Dribble of Ink</i> blog, and you can delve deep into the metaphysics behind writing and editing games and tie-in with us <a href="http://aidanmoher.com/blog/featured-article/2015/07/interview-with-james-l-sutter/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>If that's not enough, I also wrote an essay for Tor about <a href="http://torforgeblog.com/2015/06/01/what-roleplaying-teaches-writers/">what roleplaying games can teach writers</a>, and Vex Mosaic was kind enough to reprint my old essay <a href="http://www.vexmosaic.com/what-authors-owe-fans/">"What Authors Owe Fans,"</a> in which I discuss the social contracts implicit in writing a series.</p>
		<p>Last but not least, it's Gen Con time! Check out my schedule below—if you can't make it to any of the panels below, stop by the big purple Paizo booth and say hello, and <i>definitely</i> don't miss the celebrity author game on Thursday night!<p>

		<p>I'm writing this from the limbo between cons (which, if you're curious, looks suspiciously like the Seattle airport). Yesterday saw the end of an amazing Paizocon (now four days long!), and the rest of this week will be Book Expo America in NYC. Some quick highlights of the last few months:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><i>The Redemption Engine</i> has been nominated for a Scribe Award for Best Original Speculative Novel! The Scribe Awards recognize the best tie-in work of the year, and it's an honor to be nominated alongside so many great writers and properties. You can check out <a href="http://iamtw.org/the-scribe-awards/scribe-award-nominees/">the full list of nominees here</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C72513022695204011"><i>Pathfinder Origins #4</i></a>, in which I explore the gruesome nation of Nidal alongside Merisiel and Sajan, is on shelves now! Also, take a look at that awesome cover by issue artist Leandro Oliveira—Leandro's a master, and I can safely say that this issue contains the single most beautiful page of all Pathfinder comics to date.</li>
		<li>I did <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/36ia81/im_james_l_suttercocreator_of_pathfinder/?sort=confidence">a live Ask Me Anything session on Reddit</a> which was far and away my biggest one ever—thanks to everyone who asked questions!</li>
		<li>I had a great conversation about the influences of gaming on speculative fiction with Shanna Germain, Michael Underwood, and Andrea Phillips over at the <a href="http://www.roundtablepodcast.com/2015/04/rtp-dialogues-6-the-influence-of-gaming-on-speculative-fiction/">Roundtable Podcast.</a></li>

		<p>No time for posts, Dr. Jones! And yet I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a few recent developments:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Check out the <i>totally bitchin'</i> Stjepan Sejic cover for <a href="http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C72513022695202011"><i>Pathfinder Origins #2</i></a>, written by yours truly and out in March!</li>
		<li>I wrote an essay for <i>Lightspeed</i>'s QUEERS DESTROY SCIENCE FICTION PROJECT, titled <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lightspeedmagazine/queers-destroy-science-fiction/posts/1118421">"Halfway in the Pool,"</a> all about why it's okay to be just a <i>little</i> queer.</li>
		<li>Judging by the way my Twitter and email exploded when those two things hit in the same week, it seems like they both touched a nerve with folks (in a good way).</li>
		<li>I was lucky enough to get great reviews of my gay Lovecraftian romance story "The God Beneath the Mountain" from both <a href="http://fanboycomics.net/index.php/blogs/jodi-scaife/item/4670-madness-on-the-orient-express-book-review">Fanboy Comics</a> and <a href="http://thehorrorfictionreview.blogspot.com/2015/02/reviews-for-week-of-february-2-2015.html">The Horror Fiction Review</a>, both of which called the story out as one of their favorites!

		<p>Happy holidays, everybody! I've been running a thousand miles an hour trying to make headway on a new YA novel  among all the other stuff projects, but here are some neat things that popped up on the internet recently:
		<ul>
		<li>There's a new cover for <i>Madness on the Orient Express</i>, the collection from Chaosium featuring my gay Lovecraftian period romance (how's that for a kettle of buzzwords?), "The God Beneath the Mountain."</li>
		<li>I went on the <a href="http://www.roundtablepodcast.com/2014/12/20-minutes-with-james-sutter/">Writers' Roundtable Podcast</a> to talk about deadline creativity, the joy of the unexplained, the terrible glory of the outline, the difference between an artist and an artisan, and more!</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2014/11/book-review-the-redemption-engine-by-james-l-sutter/">SF Signal</a> gave <i>The Redemption Engine</i> 4 out of 5 stars, and called Salim an "intriguing and exciting character."</li>
		<li>My story "Suits" got called out in <a href="http://booksbonesbuffy.com/2014/12/18/war-stories-new-military-science-fiction-edited-by-jayme-gates-andrew-liptak-review/">Books, Bones, and Buffy's</a> review of <i>War Stories</i> as "touching and emotional."</li>
		<li>Author Kelly Jensen called out my story "Bonded Men" in her positive review of <i>Shattered Shields</i> on <a href="http://sfcrowsnest.org.uk/shattered-shields-edited-by-bryan-thomas-schmidt-and-jennifer-brozek-book-review/">SFCrowsnest</a>, saying "This story set such an unusual twist on traditional military fantasy. Needless to say, I loved it. The battle scenes were exciting and the emotion was finely wrought. The questions of love and honour beautifully answered. I would love to read more stories set in this universe."</li>
		</ul>
		<p>What more could a guy ask for for Christmas? Thanks, everyone!</p>

		<p>It's been a busy month! Thanks a ton to everyone who came out to the first Brides of the Lizard God show--it was a packed house, and I look forward to uploading videos and pictures soon. I also had a fabulous time at the World Fantasy Convention, where I continued my tradition of having amazing conversations and being told I look like other, more famous publishing people. (Lest one think I'm exaggerating, Gordon Van Gelder actually brought his family by to see the notorious Guy Who Looks Like Younger Him. The children were unconvinced.) So what else is new?</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The Skiffy and Fanty crew had me on for <a target="_blank" href="http://skiffyandfanty.com/2014/10/31/27-snowpiercer-2013-a-shoot-the-wisb-subcast-w-james-l-sutter/">a lively discussion of <i>Snowpiercer</i></a>.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://roqoodepot.com/comic-reviews/the-redemption-engine/">Roqoo Depot</a> was kind enough to post a glowing review of <i>The Redemption Engine</i>.</li>
		<li>...and so was <a target="_blank" href="http://epicroll.tumblr.com/post/99497560621/review-the-redemption-engine-by-james-l-sutter">Epic Roll</a>.</li>
		<li>There's also an excellent review of <i>War Stories</i>, a military SF anthology containing my story "Suits," over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.afantasticallibrarian.com/2014/10/jaym-gates-andrew-liptak-eds-war-stories.html">A Fantastical Librarian</a>.

		<p>The end of summer has been <i>exceptionally</i> busy, but a great big thank-you to everybody at Gen Con who stopped by to say hello and get books signed, as well as to all the awesome Pathfinder cosplayers who blew our minds repeatedly throughout the show. You all make Gen Con something we look forward to every year.</p>
		<p>As you know if you follow me on Twitter (@jameslsutter), I've been doing a ton of interviews and online appearances recently:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Over at SF Signal, I've got a new guest essay, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2014/09/guest-post-james-l-sutter-on-what-authors-owe-fans-or-maybe-george-r-r-martin-is-your-bitch/">"What Authors Owe Fans,"</a> which responds to Neil Gaiman's now-infamous blog post about how "George Martin is not your bitch." In it, I try to explore the social contract that exists between readers and authors of epic series.</li>
		<li>On the <a href="http://www.speculatesf.com/2014/08/13/episode-108-of-speculate-roundtable-discussion-with-james-l-sutter-and-mark-smylie/" target="_blank">Speculate podcast</a>, I joined author Mark Smylie and the hosts for a roundtable discussion of the business side of speculative fiction publishing.</li>
		<li>Hobart, the first journal to ever publish my fiction back when I was 19, <a href="http://www.hobartpulp.com/web_features/realism-seems-so-much-harder-a-conversation-with-james-sutter" target="_blank">just ran an interview about writing with me</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2014/09/the-sf-signal-podcast-episode-258-an-interview-with-james-l-sutter/" target="_blank">SF Signal</a> was kind enough to bring me on their podcast as well. My cup runneth over.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition to all that, my gay Lovecraftian period horror-romance, "The God Beneath the Mountain," just came out in <a href="http://www.chaosium.com/madness-on-the-orient-express/" target="_blank">Madness on the Orient Express</a> from Chaosium, alongside stories from a bunch of awesome authors, and you can pick it up by clicking the link! It's all about building the Simplon railroad tunnel, and most of the horror is bases on real-world events...</p>

If you'll be at the show, you can find me either at the following panels and seminars, or at the giant purple Paizo booth--if you can't find me at one, I'm probably at the other, and I'd love to chat and sign books! In addition, this year I'm going to be part of the pre-show entertainment at the ENnies award ceremony, playing bass for Rockonomicon, a glam rock filk band formed entirely of previous ENnies gold winners and the brainchild of madman Rone Barton. Should be a one-of-a-kind experience...</p>
			<p><b>GEN CON SEMINARS</b></p>

			</ul>
			<p>In other news, I recently got back from the Launchpad Astronomy Workshop in Wyoming, which is an intense week-long crash course in astronomy specifically for professional authors looking to put more real science in their science fiction. The course was definitely drinking from the firehose of knowledge--I took a year of astronomy in college, and we covered all of that stuff in the first two days! It was also absolutely wonderful, and in addition to learning a ton of science and getting to use an enormous telescope at a working observatory, I also made a bunch of great friends. (Pictured below: me and the YA Launchie crew--Lisa Yee, Jenn Reese, and Malinda Lo.) Spending a week in residence at the University of Wyoming was like going to back to college, except this time everyone there with me was a fascinating and successful pro author. How cool is that?!</p>
			<p>In any case, Launchpad was an incredible experience, and I'm deeply grateful to our instructors Mike Brotherton, Christian Ready, and Andria Schwortz. If you're a writer looking to start making a higher caliber of mistake in your science fiction, I can't recommend the program enough! </p>

	<div id="7/9/14" class="blogTitle"><a href="#7/9/14">7/9/14 -- New Essays, Paizocon, and Space Camp!</a></div>
		<div class="blogContent">
			<p>Looking for some nonfiction about the writing industry? Well, look no farther--I've got two new essays up online!</p>
			<p>The first, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inkpunks.com/2014/06/18/to-retweet-or-not-to-retweet-on-rebroadcasting-praise/">"To Retweet or Not to Retweet: On Rebroadcasting Praise,"</a> is all about trying to walk the line between responsible self-promoter and spammer, and how retweeting others' comments can help you get the word out. It's an issue I've wrestled with a lot, so I was glad the Inkpunks were kind enough to give my thoughts a home.</p>
			<p>The second marks my debut in the pages of <i>Clarkesworld</i>! <a target="_blank" href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/another_word_07_14/">
	"Reclaiming the Tie-in Novel"</a> is all about exploring the weird prejudice our industry has against fiction based on games or film--something I'm naturally quite interested in.</p>
			<p>On a different note, I've been lucky enough to be selected as one of the authors for the Launchpad Workshop--a week-long crash-course in astrophysics intended to keep science fiction writers from making the same ol' elementary mistakes--so I'm about to have my fantasy-writing brain squished out my ears by a load of awesome new scientific facts. But before I go, I want to say thanks again to everyone who came up to me at Paizocon to say hello! There's truly nothing more invigorating than seeing hundreds of people playing a game you worked on (or reading your book!), and I came straight home from the show and started writing. You guys are my inspiration.</p>
			<p>See you all on the flip side!</p>

		<p>You might think that, having just released a new novel, I'd be out of releases to celebrate for a bit. But you'd be WRONG!</p>
		<p> It's my great pleasure to announce the release of <i>A Different Kind of Terror</i>, the debut EP from my new band, Brides of the Lizard God! We're a self-aware arena rock band that writes everything from hair metal to punk to indie, frequently writing about dragons and starships. Our only rule is that nothing is too cheesy, so long as it is also awesome. And after months of engineering and mixing, the entire thing is now online for free for you to listen to or download! <a href="http://jameslsutter.com/brides.html">Click here to check it out!</a></p>
		<p>In other musical news, I must admit that I swooned a bit when I discovered that John Darnielle (frontman for The Mountain Goats) <a href="http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/post/87647132426/my-comparably-modest-but-very-cool-to-me-bea" target="_blank">picked up a copy of <i>The Redemption Engine</i> at Book Expo America</a>.</p>
		<p>Last but not least, award-winning game publishers Kobold Press posted <a href="http://www.koboldpress.com/k/front-page18108.php#.U55ZXZSwKH0" target="_blank">a lovely review of <i>The Redemption Engine</i></a>, saying:
		<blockquote>
		"Wow, just wow... high concepts and well-written, descriptive action sequences made this one of the best fantasy books I’ve read in a long time."
		</blockquote>
		<p>Next week I'm off to the mountains of Canada for a long-awaited road trip, but presuming I don't get eaten by bears, once I return I'll be starting in earnest on a new game book I've been wanting to write for a very long time...</p>

		<p>Things have been immensely busy the last few weeks. Thank you to everyone who's bought the new book, and an extra-special thanks to those folks who've posted reviews. Those little Goodreads/Amazon/B&N stars often mean much more than you might think, especially early in a book's life cycle, so if you've been considering taking two minutes to post a book review anywhere (whether for one of my books or someone else's), please do so! It helps a lot in convincing new readers to take a chance on an unfamiliar author.</p>
		<p>I'll be at BEA this week if you want to stop by the Paizo table in the Diamond Comics booth, but in the meantime, here's what's been going on in Ye Olde Blogge Tour:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The final chapters of "Boar and Rabbit," my web fiction serial starring Bors and Roshad from <i>The Redemption Engine</i>, is now live in its entirety, and you can <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/tales/serial/boarAndRabbit" target="_blank">read it all for free here</a>! (Just click "show post" for each chapter.) Each chapter comes with an awesome character illustration by Eric Belisle, such as the one of Bors to the right. I've been describing this story as "<i>Aladdin</i> if both he and Jasmine were gay men," and I'm hoping it lives up to the comparison!</li>
		<li>Tor.com ran what may be <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/the-pop-quiz-at-the-end-of-the-universe-james-l-sutter" target="_blank">the best interview I've ever done</a>, in which I discuss which Star Trek cast members have seen me naked, the benefits of living with a mad scientist, and marrying a lungfish. I hope it amuses you as much as it did me.</li>
		<li>Over at Skiffy and Fanty, I had a chance to discuss my superpower: <a href="http://skiffyandfanty.com/2014/05/20/my-superpower-james-l-sutter/" target="_blank">talking to people about the things that are important</a>. (Well, that and sneezeomancy.)</li>
		<li>On Dave Gross's blog, I talk about <a href="http://frabjousdave.com/creative-colleagues-james-l-sutter/" target="_blank">the undeniable importance of contractions and my formative experience with the supernatural</a>.</li>
		<li>Kristine Chester at Fanboy Comics had some choice words to say about <i>The Redemption Engine</i>: "James L. Sutter knows his stuff... There is such rich characterization here that even characters that I was shaky on upon first meeting, I learned to love... I can't remember ever feeling that way about reading an RPG fantasy novel. Best of all are the one-on-one interactions between Salim and the rest of the cast. Salim is a complex man whose strict beliefs and the way he philosophizes, argues, discusses, and learns from others kept me reading chapter after chapter... Sutter writes excellent action scenes even when the scope of an event seems like it would be impossible to write about. Sutter's descriptions of magical effects had me squirming, and his fight scenes left me tense." (Read the whole review <a href="http://fanboycomics.net/index.php/blogs/kristine-chester/item/3682" target="_blank">here</a>.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now off to pack for New York. See you all on the flip side!</p>

		<p>Last night's book launch at the University of Washington Bookstore was an absolute dream--a packed house, great questions, and a ton of autographs. In addition to books, I signed a moustache-finger, biceps, some lovely buttocks, and a truly majestic beard. I couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate my bookday, so thank you so much to everyone.</p>
		<p>So what else is going on?</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Tor.com ran <a href="http://www.tor.com/stories/2014/05/the-redemption-engine-excerpt-james-sutter" target="_blank">an illustrated sample chapter</a> from <i>The Redemption Engine</i>.</li>
		<li><a href="http://fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com/2014/05/pathfinder-tales-redemption-engine-by.html" target="_blank">Fantasy Book Critic</a> reviewed <i>The Redemption Engine</i>, saying: "I have rarely read a book with each setting so completely fleshed out: thoroughly gorgeous descriptions and thoroughly problematized conflicts. This story examines its characters' and worlds' assumptions at every turn. If you are feeling starved for high fantasy with diverse characters, definitely check this out... Kaer Maga is many things, but homogenous and predictable are not among them... If you love exploring detailed settings with diverse characters, philosophical quandaries, and sorcerous battles, check out <i>The Redemption Engine</i>."</li>
		<li>There's <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg3o?Boar-and-Rabbit" target="_blank">a new chapter of my free web fiction serial, "Boar and Rabbit,"</a> over at Paizo.com! In this chapter, we learn never-before-revealed details about the Horse Throne of central Casmaron, and the identity of that no-nonsense dude pictured on the right...</li>
		<li>I did a new AMA with Reddit Fantasy <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/24vi5i/im_james_l_sutter_author_editor_and_cocreator_of/" target="_blank">that you can read here</a>.</li>
		<li>Black Gate ran <a href="http://www.blackgate.com/2014/05/07/author-spotlight-on-james-sutter/" target="_blank">an in-depth author spotlight</a> on me, in which I quote McBain and reveal the role The Babysitters' Club had on my writing.</li>
		<li>The Grassy Gnoll ran <a href="http://thegrassygnoll.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/review-pathfinder-tales-the-redemption-engine/" target="_blank">perhaps the most thorough  review I've ever received</a>, closing with: "Read it. Right now. Then tell me how awesome it is. Go on, I’ll wait. In fact I might just reread it right now..."</li>
		<li>The SFFWRTCHT Twitter interview I did a few weeks ago <a href="http://bryanthomasschmidt.net/sffwrtcht/2014/05/06/transcript-sffwrtcht-with-editor-author-james-l-sutter/" target="_blank">now has a transcript online</a>.</li>

		<li>Chuck Wendig was kind enough to let me borrow his soapbox at Terrible Minds to reveal <a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2014/05/01/james-sutter-five-things-i-learned-writing-the-redemption-engine/" target="_blank">the most important lesson I've learned about writing</a>.</li>

		<li>The first installment of "Boar and Rabbit," my brand new 4-part serial short story starring characters from <i>The Redemption Engine</i> (including Roshad, pictured here) is now live on Paizo.com, and <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg30?Boar-and-Rabbit" target="_blank">you can read it for free</a>!

Yet while I wait in rapturous hyperventilation for this thing to finally be out in the world, there are already some nice reviews,  interviews, and other fun things filling the interwebs!</p>
		<ul>
		<li>io9's own Ed "the Grabster" Grabianowski did an extensive interview with me about the new book that you <a href="http://io9.com/in-the-redemption-engine-we-visit-an-anarcho-capitalis-1561505551" target="_blank">can check out here</a>.</li>

		<p>The release of <i>The Redemption Engine</i> is just around the corner, but in the meantime, plenty of other things have been happening!</p>
		<ul>
		<li>I was a guest geek on the most recent Geek's Guide to the Galaxy podcast over at Wired! Pathfinder Tales author Wendy N.

<div id="CrossingTheStreams" class="blogTitle"><a href="#CrossingTheStreams">2/19/14 -- Crossing the Streams Contest</a></div> 		<div class="blogContent">
<p>Do you like free books? If so, you're in luck--this year I'm taking part in Crossing the Streams 2014, a massive multi-author contest featuring a ton of cool fantasy and science fiction authors. Entering is extremely easy, so scroll down and check it out!</p>

<p><b>How it Works</b></p>

<p>Each individual author involved is running a contest on his or her own site. The specific details vary from author to author, yet each of us will select two winners from the contest on our own site. Each of those winners will receive one signed book--in my case, a copy of <i>Death's Heretic</i>--free, from the author whose contest they won. You'll also notice that I've got links to all the other authors involved below--you can only enter each author's contest once, but you can enter (and potentially win) <i>as many of the individual contests as you like.</i> We're like Pokemon--how could you not collect us all?</p>

<p>Yet that's not the big prize. Once the contests have ended, all the authors involved will get together and choose one single “super-winner” from all the entries on all our sites combined. This one lucky individual will receive a free signed book from each and every one of the authors involved. That's around twenty free books!</p>

<p>So what do you have to do to start winning all these rad prizes?</p>

<p><b>How to Enter My Contest</b></p>

<p>For me, it's simple: send me an email at <a href="mailto:james.sutter@paizo.com?subject=Crossing the Streams Entry">james.sutter@paizo.com</a> and make the subject line “Crossing the Streams Entry.” I even made you a little clickable "mailto" link so you don't have to go through the hassle of opening your email program. Such decadence!</p>

<p>That's all you <i>have</i> to do... but if you want to increase your chances of winning, include a link to a funny internet picture, gif, comic, or meme in the body of the email. Of the two winners I choose, one will be chosen completely at random, but the other will be chosen by whichever silly internet humor amuses me the most. And of course everyone who enters is also in the running for the random “super-winner” selection.</p>

<p>Entries must be received between today and March 19th, 2014, and the winners get signed copies of <i>Death's Heretic</i>! It's so easy, how could you <i>not</i> enter?</p>

<p><b>So Who Else You Got?</b></p>

<p>Below you'll find a list of all the other authors who are participating in the contest, along with links to their contest pages. But of course, the not-so-secret point of this contest is to introduce readers to new authors, so in addition to entering their contests, consider poking around their sites a bit. They might (<a href="http://jameslsutter.com/shortFiction.html">like me</a>) have links to free short stories and things, allowing you to discover the <i>real</i> grand prize--a new favorite author!</p>

While there have been mock-up covers floating around Amazon and other corners of the internet, at long last <i>The Redemption Engine</i> has been shipped to the printer, which means that I can officially unveil the final cover! Longtime Pathfinder artist Craig J Spearing did this one, and I love how hardcore both Salim and the angel look. I hope you find the story itself metal enough to warrant such an image.</p> 		<p>Yet that's not my only new picture to show off! As of this weekend, I now have my first-ever professional author photos! If you're in the Seattle area and in need of portraits or wedding photography, I highly recommend Elise Koncsek--since I'm someone who has a notoriously hard time smiling naturally for the camera (the dude who took my senior pictures in high school told me I was the hardest subject he'd ever photographed in his career), the fact that these came out looking so badass is a testament to her skill (and that of her intrepid assistants Jrd, Michelle, and Zefram).</p> 		<p>Also, Seattltes should be sure to reserve May 9th on their calendars! I'll be doing a reading/signing/launch party for <i>The Redemption Engine</i> at the University Bookstore at 7:00pm, and if the <i>Death's Heretic</i> book release party was any indication, it should be a good time for all.

		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>I'm going to be part of <i>Shattered Shields</i>, a new anthology of military fantasy from Baen that's just been announced! My story, "Bonded Men," is about an elite all-gay commando unit inspired heavily by the historical Sacred Band of Thebes. The anthology is edited by Jennifer Brozek and Bryan Thomas Schmidt, and has a total powerhouse author lineup including David Farland, Larry Correia, Glen Cook, Elizabeth Moon, and more--<a href="http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2013/12/table-of-contents-shattered-shields-edited-by-jennifer-brozek-bryan-thomas-schmidt/">you can check out the full TOC here</a>. </li>
		<li>Io9 reviewed <i>Distant Worlds</i>, my guide to the Pathfinder Campaign Setting's solar system, and had a ton of nice things to say about it! <a href="http://io9.com/explore-pathfinders-distant-worlds-with-aliens-and-sta-1489334630">Read the full article here.</a> </li>
		<li>Some media reviews have popped up for "Magic Pig," the short I did for the Pathfinder Goblins! comic series, and it sounds like people enjoyed it! You can see what they had to say at <a href="http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2013/09/04/is-it-good-pathfinder-goblins-2-review/">Adventures in Poor Taste</a> and <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=81401">First Comics News</a>.</li>

Thanks as well to everyone at PW who made the event happen. In addition to talking about epic fantasy and where it's going, we ended up having an even more important discussion about diversity in fantasy, and I also appreciate all the listeners who chimed in on the Twitter feed or in the Q&A.

		<div class="blogContent"><p><img src="./images/WarStories.jpg" align="right" width="300">Two quick things of note!
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>This Wednesday at 1:00pm EDT (that's 10:00am for my fellow West Coasters), I'm going to be doing a webcast interview for Publishers Weekly on the future of epic fantasy! The illustrious Rose Fox will be interviewing both me and Marco Palmieri from Tor, and will also be taking audience questions. Even if you can't listen to the live show, you'll be able to check it out after the fact. Get all the details <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/51220-publishers-weekly-webcasts.html">here</a> and come join us!</li>
		<li>I'm going to be part of the new War Stories military science fiction anthology from Apex Publications, alongside such awesome authors as Joe Haldeman, Ken Liu, and T. C. McCarthy. I'm honored to be in such great company, and it's destined to be one hell of a book, so if you want to get in on the ground floor, they're running <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewliptak/war-stories-modern-military-science-fiction">a Kickstarter right now</a> where you can pre-order the book, among other goodies. (I also have to call out the awesome cover by Hugo Award-winner and all around rad person Galen Dara.)</li>

		<div class="blogContent"><p><img src="./images/Pathfinder_Goblins_2.jpg" align="right" width="300">It's been a few months since the last update, and now you can see why! My exceptionally talented wife, Margo Arnold, has helped me completely overhaul this site, and I couldn't be happier with the result. (If you see anything broken or displaying improperly, however, please drop me a line.)
		</p>
		<p>So what else has been going on this summer?</p>
		<ul>
		<li>My next novel has been announced! <i>The Redemption Engine</i>, the sequel to <i>Death's Heretic</i>, will hit the streets in April 2014. Someone is stealing souls from Hell, and the word on the street is that they're giving the villains free passes into Heaven--whether they want them or not. Now Salim Ghadafar, an atheist investigator forced against his will to solve problems for the goddess of death, must descend into the outlaw city of Kaer Maga, following a trail that leads from the very gates of Heaven to the iron fortresses of Hell. Along the way, he’ll be aided by a host of otherworldly creatures, a streetwise teenager, and two warriors of the mysterious Iridian Fold. But when the missing souls are the scum of the earth, and the victims devils themselves, can anyone really be trusted? Stay tuned for more information as the release date approaches!</li>
		<li>A few weeks ago I was invited to speak about games and tie-in writing at Clarion West, perhaps the most prestigious science fiction and fantasy writing workshop around. Needless to say, speaking at the same workshop as authors like Neil Gaiman and Joe Hill was a thrill and an honor, and I had a great time hanging out with the Clarion class!</li>
		<li>I had the chance to write part of a comic book! <i>Pathfinder Goblins! #2</i> features my story "Magic Pig," paired with the story "The Glorious Demise of Gurgle and Deep" by acclaimed comics writer Charles Soule of <i>Swamp Thing</i>, <i>27</i>, <i>Wonder Woman</i>, and more.</li>
		<li>I've sold two new stories, "New Growth" and "Suits," to the anthologies <i>By Faerie Light</i> and <i>War Stories</i>.</li>
		<li>Gen Con was, as usual, both a ton of fun and completely exhausting! Many thanks to Marc Tassin and the Writer's Symposium, as well as to all the awesome writers and fans who stopped by to chat or get books signed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In short: the world is an awesome place, and I'm excited about everything!</p>

		<p>In other news, just before I left, I was also fortunate enough to be able to

		<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2013/01/geekery-for-gamers/">

		</p>
		<p>

		<blockquote>&quot;I’ve only recently started to dabble with Pathfinder, but I have to say that what I’ve seen has impressed me. A lot. Some of the advice in their books has changed the way I’ve thought about running a game, and even influenced my storytelling somewhat.&quot;</p>
			</blockquote>
		<p>Given what a huge fan I am of <i>The Name of the Wind
			</i>and <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i>, that's high praise indeed. Thank,

		supercarrier, and one of the largest warships ever constructed by
		humanity--invited Paizo staff aboard for a thorough tour of the closest thing
		the real world has to a star destroyer. (That picture is me sitting in the boss
		chair--the miniboss chair is off to my right. Those are their actual titles.) It
		was a ton of fun, and I challenge anyone to stand on a machine three football
		fields long, powered by three nuclear reactors and capable of doing 50
		mph while launching its 70 jets, and not geek out a little bit. Thanks again to
		Commander Paris Crenshaw and Lieutenant Commander Lucas Jung for leading a bunch
		of nerds around the most expensive object most of us will ever see in person.</p>

books that inspire us, tips for folks taking a shot at NaNoWriMo (hint: just
keep writing), and even the Secret Paizo Motto. Thanks to some sort of computer

I'm back from the odyssey that was this year's World
Fantasy Convention, and as always, I can't thank enough the various friends, old
and new, who made it such a blast. Yet while I'm concentrating on lying very
still and trying not to expire from sheer exhaustion, there are two new
interviews to check out!</p>
<p>

First up, the Slice of SciFi radio show did an
interview with me and Paizo Editor-in-Chief Wes Schneider, which in addition to
showing up on satellite radio can also be watched as a webcast TV show. We
talked about Pathfinder's origins, Pathfinder Tales, and the secret agenda
behind writing <i>Death's Heretic</i>, which they were kind enough to
call &quot;a fantastic book.&quot; You can
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2012/10/31/slice-of-scifi-509/">
listen to or watch the interview here</a> (starting
around nine minutes in).
	</p>
<p>

Second, the Know Direction podcast did an interview
with me and Pathfinder Tales author Dave Gross about about his new book <i>
Queen of Thorns</i> and my work designing Pathfinder's solar system,
<a target="_blank" href="http://35privatesanctuary.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=474:know-direction-49-distant-tales&catid=35:the-tome-know-direction&Itemid=34">

This past Gen Con, I was fortunate enough to be

In other new, my latest Pathfinder adventure, <i>
The Asylum Stone</i>, is set to hit stores on the 31st, so it seems like a
great opportunity to show off the cover (courtesy of my friend Wayne Reynolds,
one of the best fantasy illustrators in the business). Believe it or not, it
didn't occur to me until right now that we're releasing a headless horseman
cover on Halloween...<p align="center">

The Geek Love Kickstarter has finished, and at almost $33,000 dollars has
succeeded far beyond anyone's wildest dreams, making it one of the best-funded
publishing projects around! Thanks to everyone who supported it, and I hope that
the huge amount of sexy nerdity the book (and audiobook!) contains will float
your boat!</p>
<p>

Seattleites--this Saturday I'll be playing at a benefit show for the Bike Shack,
an awesome nonprofit that helps fix or build bikes for people for free, and
which recently had all their tools stolen. I'll be playing a short &quot;Greatest
Hits&quot; set with several special guests, and there are a ton of other bands
involved, from eccentric back-porch stomp-along folk music to the danciest of
techno. (It should be noted that I had no idea the organizers were putting my
picture on the poster until they sent it to me--in my opinion, The Mongrel Jews
and Foreign Friends are likely to steal the show!)



	</p>
<p>

Details: 8017 1st Ave NE Seattle--the suggested donation is $5, sliding-scale
bike tune-ups starts at 5:00, and music starts at 7:00. Expect much hilarity,
raffles, a strip show or two, and general good times!<br>

<p>

	Wait, did I say MMO addiction? I meant <i>sexy</i> MMO addiction!

	some really kick-ass authors and artists, and I hope you'll check it out.
	The ebook will be for sale in perpetuity once the book's released, but if

	&quot;Masters of the Controverse: Why Authors Should Speak

	politicians, and other public figures) are told that they should sanitize
	their images and never speak about controversial topics. Yet I believe that
	not only is it important for everyone to be able to address the issues that
	matter to them, but that, contrary to popular wisdom, doing so can actually
	lead to a stronger fan base. <br>

a positive review of<i>
Death's Heretic</i></a> up at
Bibliophile Stalker. Both might make a nice diversion today, since much of the
internet is on blackout thanks to PIPA and SOPA. (If you haven't written your
government representatives about them yet, please do so!)</p>

Also, don't forget that next Monday is the Seattle U Bookstore signing!&nbsp;

I've got a new guest blog over at Apex Book Company called
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.apexbookcompany.com/blogs/blog/5165362-a-house-divided-science-fiction-versus-fantasy">
&quot;A House Divided: Science Fiction Versus Fantasy.&quot;</a>
It's all about the stereotypes and prejudice fans of one subgenre have for the
other, and vice versa. I went out and found a bunch of folks who enjoy one but
not the other and asked them why they felt that way, and some of the answers
were
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.apexbookcompany.com/blogs/blog/5165362-a-house-divided-science-fiction-versus-fantasy">

<p>
In somewhat less related news, yesterday was a snow day, which everyone in
Seattle knows is a spontaneous holiday. I rode a sled through a stranger's hedge
at 30 miles per hour while blowing a plastic trumpet. As far as I'm concerned,
if your snow day doesn't end with shouts of &quot;I'm in a tree! I'M IN A TREE!&quot; you
may need to reconsider your lifestyle.</p>

<div class="blogContent"><p>
</a>Another podcast story? It's true! The illustrious PodCastle has just
released &quot;Ties of Silver,&quot; which I originally published in <i>Beast Within 2:
Predator &amp; Prey</i>, as a free podcast that
<a target="_blank" href="http://podcastle.org/2011/12/13/podcastle-187-ties-of-silver/">
you can listen to here.</a> The story is a noir
piece about a city where all werewolves and other lycanthropes are kept in a
WW2-style ghetto and forced to take tinctures of silver to control their
changing if they want to leave the reservation (a &quot;solution&quot; that also marks
them by turning their skin blue).

it's absolutely surreal. Thank you, everyone!</p>

</a>Josh Vogt gave <i>Death's Heretic</i> a glowing review over at Examiner--extra
heartening because he apparently didn't realize it was tie-in fiction when he
first picked it up! Here's an excerpt:</p>
<p>

<i>"Excellent writing, a fascinating character, and a solid fantasy-mystery plot... Salim is a marvelous character to be introduced to this universe through. Neila is a great counterpoint... she avoids falling into the trap of being nothing more than a pretty face for Salim to rescue every other chapter. Refreshing, that. With its intriguing protagonist, twisted magics, and unique environments, it's well worth discovering..."

	&quot;Don't Self-Reject!&quot;</a> If you aren't already
	familiar with the Inkpunks, you should check them out--they've got a lot to
	say, and it's worth hearing. Thanks as well to SF Signal, Sterling Editing,
	and the various other folks who helped spread the word.</p>

	In totally non-literary news, the musical I co-wrote and acted in last year
	is finally on the web! As a present for a friend, a cast and crew of about
	20 folks got together and wrote &quot;The Science of Science,&quot; a morality play
	starring said friend as a scientist struggling against a society that can't
	be bothered with facts. In addition to writing about half the music (the
	other half being provided by my good friend Andy Greenlee, in accordance
	with a script by Michelle Burce), I got to shave off my beard and play the
	lead, while another friend did a terrifyingly good job of playing the
	character of me (talk about surreal!). Most of the folks involved were
	taking the stage for the first time, and the result is astonishing.
