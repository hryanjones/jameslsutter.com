<p>Now that I've survived the whirlwind of awesomeness that is Gen Con, it's 
time to relate some news! Not about Gen Con--though the friends, the comments 
from Pathfinder fans, and the slew of ENnies all made for a completely 
unforgettable show-- but rather a new story sale, a new compilation, and a new 
cover!



	<p>The new story, &quot;Guns at the Hellroad,&quot; is a gunslinger western in a 
	post-Rapture future, and will appear in<i> <b>New Heroes II</b></i> from

	and which originally appeared alongside the Kingmaker Adventure Path. And 
	the cover is for <b><i>Beast Within 2: Predator &amp; Prey</i></b>, which 
	contains my story &quot;Ties of Silver&quot; and is

	<p>At long last, I'm pleased to be able to announce that my first novel, <b>
	<i>Death's Heretic</i></b>, will be released from Paizo in November 2011! 
	It's a dimension-hopping mystery starring Salim Ghadafar, a desert warrior 
	with a haunted past who's forced against his will to work as an agent of the 
	goddess of death. It's one part Spawn, one part Blade Runner, and one part 
	Dante's Divine Comedy, and I can't wait to see what people think of it!</p>
	<p>I broke the news in <b>
	<a href="http://atomicarray.com/pathfinder-tales-aase003">
	<font color="#FFFFFF">this extensive podcast interview</font></a></b> over 
	at Atomic Array, which also includes such excellent Pathfinder Tales 
	novelists as Howard Andrew Jones, Dave Gross, and Robin D. Laws. <b>

<img border="0" src="PZOTEB0006E_500.jpeg" width="300" align="right"><p>
	It's officially the future! Paizo just released an ebook compilation 
	of the first 18 Pathfinder's Journals, collecting the entire Eando Kline 
	story arc. <b> <i><a href="http://paizo.com/store/v5748btpy8k9k">
	<font color="#FFFFFF">The Compass Stone: The Collected Journals of Eando Kline</font></a>&nbsp; </i>
	</b>is a novel-length experiment in collaborative storytelling, with a host of different authors each contributing chapters to the story. I had the pleasure of editing and guiding the original series, as well as editing and introducing this collection, and wrote about a third of the 
	episodes. Clocking in at roughly 80,000 words (novel length), with more than 50 illustrations, this 
	collection is pretty darn meaty, and is available at both
	<a href="http://paizo.com/store/v5748btpy8k9k"><font color="#FFFFFF">paizo.com</font></a> and the iBookstore.


	<p>
	On a personal note: Eando was the first character I ever wrote multiple 
	stories about, and the experience of putting together his overarching plot 
	and attempting to weave a dozen authors into a fun, cohesive story taught me 
	much about the art of crafting a novel. My chapter &quot;Hand of the Handless&quot; 
	also represents the first appearance of Kaer Maga and things like bloatmages, 
	sweettalkers, wormfolk, troll augurs, and all the other details that 
	eventually grew into the sourcebook<i> <b>City of Strangers.</b> </i>

	be disappointed! (Well, at least not by the reading.)<p>Next up, there are a 
	couple of new covers online: the anthology Broken Time Blues (formerly known 
	as 20spec, and in which I have a story) now has an awesome official cover, 
	and the free Pathfinder Chronicler fanfiction anthology (for which I wrote a 
	guest introduction) totally blew my mind with its excellent Eva Widermann 
	cover. Seriously, that's one of the best covers I've seen from a gaming 
	tie-in book, and for a free fan-run project to have achieved so much... it's 
	really impressive.<p>Still more news on the way, but I don't think I'm <i>
	quite </i>able to announce what I've been dying to tell everyone. Soon....<p>&nbsp;<p>

	Just saw the cover for Jennifer Brozeck's new anthology, <i><b>Human Tales</b>,
	</i>from Dark Quest books. My story, &quot;Holding the Line,&quot; is all about 
	goblins and their obsession with princesses. Once upon a time, goblins 
	agreed to protect humanity's young princesses from the forces of darkness. 
	But what happens when thousands of generations go by, and now every little 
	girl on Earth has a bit of princess blood in her?<p>
	In other news... well, actually, I still can't talk about the big news just 
	yet. But it looks like I may finally be able to spill the beans soon about a 
	project that's been in the works for the last year....<p>

	2</i></b>, a new anthology of non-standard lycanthrope stories from 
	Graveside Tales. The story is a noir piece about a government-run

	<font face="Book Antiqua">VICTORY! If you missed the action, yesterday <i>
	Machine of Death</i> <b><u>succeeded in becoming the #1 best-selling book on 
	Amazon.com</u> for the entire day</b>. By leveraging the power of their 
	fanbases, several of the notable webcomics figures involved with the project 
	managed to help the book beat out John Grisham, Robert Jordan, Glenn Beck 
	(take that, Beck!), Jon Stewart (sorry, Jon!), and <b><i>everyone else on 
	Amazon</i></b> to take the top spot. In fact, in addition to holding the #1 
	spot for a day, the book's also shown remarkable staying power, and is 
	currently still at #3. It's really impressive to see that a book that was 
	turned down by numerous publishers--and for totally sensible reasons--is now 
	making such a huge splash. Definitely a coup for small-press indie 
	publishers, and I'm incredibly thankful to have been involved with the 
	project! http://io9.com/5676104/indie-science-fiction-anthology-incurs-the-wrath-of-glenn-beck</font><p>

	<font face="Book Antiqua">It's been a big month for anthologies! First up, 
	and most crucial time-wise, is <i>Machine of Death</i>--the awesome theme 
	anthology from some of the biggest names on the internet, including Ryan 
	North, David Malki !, Matthew Bennardo, Randall Munroe, and more--is 
	available and tearing up the charts at Amazon.com.<b> <u>
	<a href="http://machineofdeath.net/a/mod-day"><font color="#FFFFFF">But 
	don't buy it yet!</font></a></u></b> The folks who put the anthology 
	together have organized a push to have everyone buy it on <b>Tuesday, 
	October 26th</b>, hopefully helping it become a #1 best-seller for a day. 
	With every story illustrated by a different prominent webcomic artist, this 
	anthology is really something special. (I was fortunate enough to draw Rene 
	Engstrom of Anders Loves Maria as my artist... swoon!) Check it out:</font><p align="center">

	Publishing's new post-apocalyptic anthology, is now available as well 
	through their website (the only way I know of for us folks in the colonies 
	to get it), and I'm really excited. My story in this one, &quot;The Long Road to 
	the Sea,&quot; is my favorite short piece I've written to date--a sort of 
	post-apocalyptic zombie love story, from the zombie's point of view. Oh 
	yeah, and the anthology has a few names you might recognize, such as Brian 
	Aldiss. Unfortunately, I can't find a bigger image of the cover art, but 
	it's a really nice, solid hardcover--totally worth shipping it over via 
	pilot whale, or however such things are done. Grab it here:</font><p align="center">

	about a world where a machine cheaply and easily predicts how people will 
	die--has been a long time in coming (I sold them the story four years ago), 
	but it's finally releasing this October, and you should totally pick up a
