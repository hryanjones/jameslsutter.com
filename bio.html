	<p>James L. Sutter is a co-creator of the Pathfinder and Starfinder Roleplaying Games. From 2004 to 2017, he worked as an editor and developer for Paizo Publishing, starting on <i>Dungeon</i> Magazine, moving on to do foundational work for Pathfinder, and eventually becoming the Creative Director in charge of launching Starfinder, as well as the Executive Editor of the Pathfinder Tales novel line. In 2017, after guiding Starfinder through the most successful game launch in Paizo's history, he resigned from the company in order to write full-time.</p>

	<p>James is the author of the novels <i>Death's Heretic</i>—ranked #3 on Barnes &amp; Noble's Best Fantasy Releases of 2011 and a finalist for the Compton Crook Award for Best First Novel—and <i>The Redemption Engine</i>, which won the 2015 Scribe Award for Best Original Speculative Novel. In addition to a wealth of award-winning tabletop gaming material, he's also written comics, video games, and essays and short stories for such publications as <i>Escape Pod, Apex Magazine, Queers Destroy Science Fiction, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Clarkesworld,</i> and the #1 Amazon best-seller <i>Machine of Death</i>.</p>

	<p>When not writing or editing, James has performed with bands and other musical projects ranging from punk and progressive metalcore to folk and musical theater. He lives in Seattle in a shared house called Mooncastle, along with his wife and several friends.</p>

	<p>James is represented by Cameron McClure of the Donald Maass Literary Agency for publishing, and Hannah Vaughn and Joe Veltre at The Gersh Agency for film and television.</p>
